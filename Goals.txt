Accomplishments to date (12/7/25)

Can fetch & parse BMRB shift data
Can run DSSP if given a PDB

To do:
automatically pair BMRB entries with their PDB structures hence produce shift statistics grouped by secondary structure

Want to do by end of week:
-Can retrieve data from the BMRB, including chemical shift data
-Can use DSSP for secondary structure prediction

Goals:
-Given a PDB model (which may or may not be correct), can you predict 13C NMR chemical shifts?

-Can we automate assignments (most 13C) of 1D or 2D NMR spectra using DSSP or other chemical shift data from databases.
