Updated Timeline (1/27)
Right now we can
 download real experimental NMR data from the BMRB
extract hundreds of 13C / 15N chemical shifts correctly
 aggregate them into meaningful statistics
generate a reference CSV that reflects real chemistry


Final Project is 

    1. Prediction
    > Given a 3D protein model (PDB), predict what its 13C NMR spectrum should look like.
    2. Assignment
    > Given an experimental spectrum, automatically guess which peak belongs to which atom.

Updated Timeline:

    PHASE 1 — Build the chemical shift knowledge base (COMPLETE WOOO)
        “I’ve built a system that learns chemical shift behavior from real NMR data, and I’m now adding structural awareness so it can predict and assign spectra.”
    PHASE 2 — Make the statistics structure-aware
        • Get DSSP working reliably
        • Ensure residue numbering matches BMRB
        • Recompute statistics split by secondary structure
    PHASE 3 — Turn statistics into a predictor
        Input:
            • PDB file
            • amino acid sequence
            • secondary structure
        Output:
            • predicted chemical shifts for each atom
    PHASE 4 — Simulate an NMR spectrum
        • add peak broadening
        • add relative intensities
        • generate 1D spectra
    PHASE 5 — Automated assignment (the hard part)
        take an experimental spectrum
        • compare it to predictions
        • score all possible assignments
        • pick the most likely ones
