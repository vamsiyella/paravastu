TECHNICAL ROADMAP

1. Clean and validate BMRB+DSSP shift database
2. Use DSSP + statistics to predict shifts from PDB models
3. Compare predictions to experiments to validate structures
4. Match experimental peaks to database distributions
5. Automate assignments using optimization and constraints


PHASE 1 — CLEAN & TRUST THE DATABASE (QUALITY CONTROL)

Before prediction, you must trust the data.
COOKIE VERSION
Before learning how chips melt, you throw out burned cookies, half-baked ones, and weird experimental recipes.
WHAT TO DO

1. Filter bad data
2. • Remove entries with missing atoms
3. • Remove residues labeled “unknown” structure
4. • Optionally keep only high-resolution PDBs
5. Separate by structure clearly
6. • Helix
7. • Beta-sheet
8. • Coil
9. Verify distributions visually
10. • Histograms for CA/CB per residue
11. • Confirm beta-sheet distributions are narrower (they usually are)

OUTPUT
A trusted reference database you believe in.

----------
PHASE 2 — STRUCTURE → SHIFT PREDICTION (GOAL 1)

Now prediction begins.
COOKIE VERSION
Someone hands you a cookie drawing and asks:
“If it looks like this, how melted should the chips be?”
WHAT TO DO

1. Input: a PDB file
2. • Could be real
3. • Could be wrong
4. • Doesn’t matter
5. Run DSSP on it
6. • Label every residue as helix / sheet / coil
7. Walk residue by residue
8. For each amino acid:
9. • Look up its CA, CB, etc. distributions
10. • Choose the correct one based on structure
11. Predict shifts
12. Options:
13. • Mean shift
14. • Mean ± std
15. • Sample from distribution
16. Output:
17. • Table of predicted shifts
18. • Optional simulated 13C spectrum

OUTPUT
A predicted 13C chemical shift list for the PDB model.
This already lets you test:
“Does this structure make sense given my spectrum?”

----------
PHASE 3 — COMPARE PREDICTION TO EXPERIMENT (MODEL TESTING)

COOKIE VERSION
You predicted how chips should melt.
Now you taste the real cookie and compare.
WHAT TO DO

1. Overlay predicted peaks on experimental spectrum
2. Measure errors (ppm differences)
3. Identify mismatches:
4. • Wrong structure?
5. • Wrong residue placement?
6. • Dynamics or disorder?
7. Score models
8. • RMSD between predicted and experimental shifts

OUTPUT
A structure validation tool.
This is extremely powerful:
You can now say whether a PDB model agrees with solid-state NMR data.

----------
PHASE 4 — PEAK IDENTIFICATION (PRE-ASSIGNMENT)

Now we reverse the logic.
COOKIE VERSION
You have melted chips on a plate.
You ask: “What ingredient could have made this?”
WHAT TO DO

1. Take experimental peaks (1D or 2D)
2. For each peak:
3. • Compare against all database distributions
4. • Compute likelihoods

Example:
“Peak at 56.8 ppm is:
70% Ser-CA (sheet)
20% Lys-CA
10% something else”

3. Use sequence knowledge
4. • Only allow residues present
5. • Use counts (e.g., 6 Ser, 6 Leu)

OUTPUT
A ranked list of candidate assignments per peak.

----------
PHASE 5 — AUTOMATED ASSIGNMENT ENGINE (GOAL 2)

COOKIE VERSION
Now the computer assigns chips automatically — no human guessing.
WHAT TO DO

1. Treat assignment as a matching problem
2. • Peaks ↔ residue-atom slots
3. Add constraints
4. • Sequence composition
5. • Expected counts
6. • Peak intensities
7. • Structural context (beta-sheet only)
8. Use scoring / optimization
9. • Hungarian algorithm
10. • Greedy matching
11. • Probabilistic inference
12. Output final assignments with confidence scores
13. • “Peak A → Ser-CA (95%)”

OUTPUT
A fully automated assignment system for most 13C sites.

----------
PHASE 6 — EXTENSIONS (OPTIONAL BUT NATURAL)

Once the core works, you can add:
• 2D correlations (CA–CB pairs = huge accuracy boost)
• Side-chain carbons
• Dynamics (multiple conformations)
• Disorder detection
• Bayesian models
• Machine learning (later, optional)
